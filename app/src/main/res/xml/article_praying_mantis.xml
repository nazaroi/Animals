        <p>The praying mantis is named for its prominent front legs, which are bent and held
            together at an angle that suggests the position of prayer.

        <section>Hunting Adaptations</section>
        <p>By any name, these fascinating insects are formidable predators. They have triangular
            heads poised on a long "neck," or elongated thorax. Mantids can turn their heads 180
            degrees to scan their surroundings with two large compound eyes and three other simple
            eyes located between them.
        </p>
        <p>Typically green or brown and well camouflaged on the plants among which they live, mantis
            lie in ambush or patiently stalk their quarry. They use their front legs to snare their
            prey with reflexes so quick that they are difficult to see with the naked eye. Their
            legs are further equipped with spikes for snaring prey and pinning it in place.

        <section>Breeding and Behavior</section>
        <p>Moths, crickets, grasshoppers, flies, and other insects are usually the unfortunate
            recipients of unwanted mantid attention. However, the insects will also eat others of
            their own kind. The most famous example of this is the notorious mating behavior of the
            adult female, who sometimes eats her mate just after—or even during—mating. Yet this
            behavior seems not to deter males from reproduction.
        </p>
        <p>Females regularly lay hundreds of eggs in a small case, and nymphs hatch looking much
            like tiny versions of their parents.
