        <description>After eggs are laid, it generally takes 60 to 90 days for the hatchlings to
            break free of their leathery shell.

        <p>The red-eared slider gets its name from the small red stripe around its ears and from its
            ability to slide quickly off rocks and logs into the water. This species was previously
            known as Troost's turtle in honor of an American herpetologist Gerard Troost.
        </p>
        <section>Taxonomy</section>
        <p>The red-eared slider belongs to the order Testudines which contains about 250 turtle
            species. It is a subspecies of Trachemys scripta. It was previously classified under the
            name Chrysemys scripta elegans.
        </p>
        <p>The species Trachemys scripta contains three subspecies: T. s. elegans (red-eared
            slider), T. s. scripta (yellow-bellied slider), and T. s. troostii (Cumberland slider).

        <section>Description</section>
        <p>The carapace of this species can reach more than 40 cm (16 in) in length, but the average
            length ranges from 15 to 20 cm (6 to 8 in). The females of the species are usually
            larger than the males. They typically live between 20 and 30 years, although some
            individuals have lived for more than 40 years. Their life expectancy is shorter when
            they are kept in captivity. The quality of their living environment has a strong
            influence on their lifespans and well being.
        </p>
        <p>These turtles are poikilotherms, meaning they are unable to regulate their body
            temperatures independently; they are completely dependent on the temperature of their
            environment. For this reason, they need to sunbathe frequently to warm themselves and
            maintain their body temperatures
        </p>
        <section>Distribution and habitat</section>
        <p>The red-eared slider originated from the area around the Mississippi River and the Gulf
            of Mexico, in warm climates in the southeastern United States. Their native areas range
            from the southeast of Colorado to Virginia and Florida. In nature, they inhabit areas
            with a source of still, warm water, such as ponds, lakes, swamps, creeks, streams, or
            slow-flowing rivers. They live in areas of calm water where they are able to leave the
            water easily by climbing onto rocks or tree trunks so they can warm up in the sun.
            Individuals are often found sunbathing in a group or even on top of each other. They
            also require abundant aquatic plants, as these are the adults' main food, although they
            are omnivores. Turtles in the wild always remain close to water unless they are
            searching for a new habitat or when females leave the water to lay their eggs.
