        <p>The cheetah is the world's fastest land mammal. With acceleration that would leave most
            automobiles in the dust, a cheetah can go from 0 to 60 miles an hour in only three
            seconds. These big cats are quite nimble at high speed and can make quick and sudden
            turns in pursuit of prey.

        <section>Speed and Hunting</section>
        <p>Before unleashing their speed, cheetahs use exceptionally keen eyesight to scan their
            grassland environment for signs of preyâ€”especially antelope and hares. This big cat is a
            daylight hunter that benefits from stealthy movement and a distinctive spotted coat that
            allows it to blend easily into high, dry grasses.

        <p>When the moment is right a cheetah will sprint after its quarry and attempt to knock it
            down. Such chases cost the hunter a tremendous amount of energy and are usually over in
            less than a minute. If successful, the cheetah will often drag its kill to a shady
            hiding place to protect it from opportunistic animals that sometimes steal a kill before
            the cheetah can eat. Cheetahs need only drink once every three to four days.
        </p>
        <section>Breeding and Population</section>
        <p>Female cheetahs typically have a litter of three cubs and live with them for one and a
            half to two years. Young cubs spend their first year learning from their mother and
            practicing hunting techniques with playful games. Male cheetahs live alone or in small
            groups, often with their littermates.
        </p>
        <p>Most wild cheetahs are found in eastern and southwestern Africa. These populations are
            under pressure as the wide-open grasslands they favor are disappearing at the hands of
            human settlers.
