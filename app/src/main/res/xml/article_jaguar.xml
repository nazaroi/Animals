        <p>Jaguars are the largest of South America's big cats. They once roamed from the southern
            tip of that continent north to the region surrounding the U.S.-Mexico border. Today
            significant numbers of jaguars are found only in remote regions of South and Central
            America—particularly in the Amazon Basin.
        </p>
        <p>These beautiful and powerful beasts were prominent in ancient Native American cultures.
            In some traditions the Jaguar God of the Night was the formidable lord of the
            underworld. The name jaguar is derived from the Native American word yaguar, which means
            “he who kills with one leap.”

        <p>Unlike many other cats, jaguars do not avoid water; in fact, they are quite good
            swimmers. Rivers provide prey in the form of fish, turtles, or caimans—small,
            alligatorlike animals. Jaguars also eat larger animals such as deer, peccaries,
            capybaras, and tapirs. They sometimes climb trees to prepare an ambush, killing their
            prey with one powerful bite.

        <p>Most jaguars are tan or orange with distinctive black spots, dubbed "rosettes" because
            they are shaped like roses. Some jaguars are so dark they appear to be spotless, though
            their markings can be seen on closer inspection.
        </p>
        <p>Jaguars live alone and define territories of many square miles by marking with their
            waste or clawing trees.

        <p>Females have litters of one to four cubs, which are blind and helpless at birth. The
            mother stays with them and defends them fiercely from any animal that may approach—even
            their own father. Young jaguars learn to hunt by living with their mothers for two years
            or more.
        </p>
        <p>Jaguars are still hunted for their attractive fur. Ranchers also kill them because the
            cats sometimes prey upon their livestock.
