        <p>Tigers are the largest members of the cat family and are renowned for their power and
            strength.

        <section>Tiger Populations</section>
        <p>There were eight tiger subspecies at one time, but three became extinct during the 20th
            century. Over the last 100 years, hunting and forest destruction have reduced tiger
            populations from hundreds of thousands of animals to perhaps fewer than 2,500. Tigers
            are hunted as trophies, and also for body parts that are used in traditional Chinese
            medicine. All five remaining tiger subspecies are at-risk, and many protection programs
            are in place.

        <p>Bengal tigers live in India and are sometimes called Indian tigers. They are the most
            common tiger and number about half of all wild tigers. Over many centuries they have
            become an important part of Indian tradition and lore. (To learn more, watch this video
            about what's driving tigers to extinction.)
        </p>
        <section>Behavior</section>
        <p>Tigers live alone and aggressively scent-mark large territories to keep their rivals
            away. They are powerful nocturnal hunters that travel many miles to find buffalo, deer,
            wild pigs, and other large mammals. Tigers use their distinctive coats as camouflage (no
            two have exactly the same stripes). They lie in wait and creep close enough to attack
            their victims with a quick spring and a fatal pounce. A hungry tiger can eat as much as
            60 pounds in one night, though they usually eat less.
        </p>
        <p>Despite their fearsome reputation, most tigers avoid humans; however, a few do become
            dangerous maneaters. These animals are often sick and unable to hunt normally, or live
            in an area where their traditional prey has vanished.

        <p>Females give birth to litters of two to six cubs, which they raise with little or no
            help from the male. Cubs cannot hunt until they are 18 months old and remain with their
            mothers for two to three years, when they disperse to find their own territory.
