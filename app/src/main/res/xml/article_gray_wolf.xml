        <p>Wolves are legendary because of their spine-tingling howl, which they use to communicate.
            A lone wolf howls to attract the attention of his pack, while communal howls may send
            territorial messages from one pack to another. Some howls are confrontational. Much like
            barking domestic dogs, wolves may simply begin howling because a nearby wolf has already
            begun.

        <section>Population and Conservation</section>
        <p>Wolves are the largest members of the dog family. Adaptable gray wolves are by far the
            most common and were once found all over the Northern Hemisphere. But wolves and humans
            have a long adversarial history. Though they almost never attack humans, wolves are
            considered one of the animal world's most fearsome natural villains. They do attack
            domestic animals, and countless wolves have been shot, trapped, and poisoned because of
            this tendency.
        </p>
        <p>In the lower 48 states, gray wolves were hunted to near extinction, though some
            populations survived and others have since been reintroduced. Few gray wolves survive in
            Europe, though many live in Alaska, Canada, and Asia.

        <section>Wolf Pack Behavior</section>
        <p>Wolves live and hunt in packs of around six to ten animals. They are known to roam large
            distances, perhaps 12 miles in a single day. These social animals cooperate on their
            preferred preyâ€”large animals such as deer, elk, and moose. When they are successful,
            wolves do not eat in moderation. A single animal can consume 20 pounds of meat at a
            sitting. Wolves also eat smaller mammals, birds, fish, lizards, snakes, and fruit.
        </p>
        <p>Wolfpacks are established according to a strict hierarchy, with a dominant male at the
            top and his mate not far behind. Usually this male and female are the only animals of
            the pack to breed. All of a pack's adults help to care for young pups by bringing them
            food and watching them while others hunt.
